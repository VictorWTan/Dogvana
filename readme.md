Dogvana is an app that allows you to browse adoptable pets and 
view all of the pertinent adoption information. Once logged in to 
Dogvana, you can add pets to your favorites page where all of your 
favorite animals are housed. Each favorite animal on the favorites 
page, when clicked, will bring you to that animals page and allow 
the user to create notes to compare which animals will work the best
in the users home. Once the user decides which animal(s) they would 
like to adopt, you can submit a form to contact the shelter or foster. 


## User Story

As a user, I want the ability to view all of the animals in the api filtered by zipcode because it is important to know where I can adopt a dog from and what type of dog I will be adopting. 

Also, I would like to be able to add favorites animals from petfinder that are able to be adopted so I can see all of the potential dogs I could adopt. 

Finally I would like the ability to create notes in each favorite animal because I would like to weigh the pros and cons of each animal I would like to adopt.
